Inspired by the Build Mobile Apps With Flutter and Google Maps (Cloud Next '19) presentation

You can view the presentation for this session here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpQLFAFqMlw

You will have to get a Google Maps API key in order to get the demo running. Instructions on how to do that can be found here: https://pub.dev/packages/google_maps_flutter
